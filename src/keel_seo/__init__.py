"""Package version, derived rather than restated.

This file held a hand-written string, and on 2026-09-03 it was reporting 0.26.0
from an installation of 0.27.0 - the CI version guard compares the git tag with
`pyproject.toml` and never looks here, so a bump that forgot this line failed
nothing and the wrong number was what every log line and every report printed.
The installed metadata is the same value `pyproject.toml` produced, so reading it
cannot disagree with it; a source checkout with no metadata falls back to the one
file the guard does check.
